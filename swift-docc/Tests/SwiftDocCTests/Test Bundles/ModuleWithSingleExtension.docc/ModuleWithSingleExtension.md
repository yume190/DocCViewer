# ``ModuleWithSingleExtension``

This module contains an extension to Swift's Array type, and en empty enum to curate it into.

## Overview

The purpose of this test fixture is to ensure that when extension symbols are curated outside of
their default location of their extended module/symbol, that an empty module/symbol page isn't left
behind to confuse readers.
