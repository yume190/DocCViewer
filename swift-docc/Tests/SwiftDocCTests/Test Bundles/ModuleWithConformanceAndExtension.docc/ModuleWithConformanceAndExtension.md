# ``ModuleWithConformanceAndExtension``

This test bundle contains symbol graphs which define a protocol (`MyProtocol`) and a conformance of
`Bool` to that protocol. It also extends `Bool` with a new property. By curating the property below,
the "Extended Symbol" pages for `Bool` and `Swift` should disappear. As well, the conformance of
`Bool` to `MyProtocol` should still appear on `MyProtocol`'s page, but the link should not be live.

## Topics

- ``MyProtocol``
- ``Swift/Bool/asdf``
